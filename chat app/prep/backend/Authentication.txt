1. Authentication (basic idea)
When you log in to a website/app (like Gmail, Netflix, etc.), the system needs to know who you are for every request you make after login. That‚Äôs called authentication.

2. Traditional (stateful) authentication
Normally, when you log in, the server stores your session info in memory or database (called state).
	‚Ä¢ Example: You log in ‚Üí server creates a ‚Äúsession record‚Äù ‚Üí gives you a session ID ‚Üí you send it in every request.
	‚Ä¢ Problem: Server has to remember sessions for all users. If the server restarts or scales to multiple servers, it becomes difficult.

3. JWT (JSON Web Token)
JWT is just a token (a string) that contains:
	‚Ä¢ Who you are (user ID, email, etc.)
	‚Ä¢ Some extra info (roles, expiry time, etc.)
	‚Ä¢ A digital signature to make sure it‚Äôs not tampered.
It looks like this:


xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

4. Stateless authentication with JWT
‚ÄúStateless‚Äù means the server does not remember anything about you.
	‚Ä¢ When you log in, the server gives you a JWT.
	‚Ä¢ You send that JWT in every request (usually in the Authorization header).
	‚Ä¢ The server checks the signature and reads info directly from the token ‚Äî no need to check any session storage.
So the state is inside the token itself, not stored on the server.

‚úÖ Simple analogy:
	‚Ä¢ Stateful: You go to a club, and the guard writes your name in a register (server keeps state). Every time you enter, he checks the register.
	‚Ä¢ Stateless with JWT: Instead of keeping a register, the guard gives you a stamp on your hand (JWT). Next time you enter, he only checks the stamp. The club doesn‚Äôt keep any list.

üëâ That‚Äôs why JWT-based stateless authentication is popular for APIs and scalable systems ‚Äî the server doesn‚Äôt need to remember who you are; it just verifies your token.

Good question üëç
A JWT (JSON Web Token) always has three parts, separated by dots (.):


xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
These three parts are called:
	1. Header
		‚óã Tells which algorithm is used for signing (e.g., HS256).
		‚óã Example:


{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

	2. Payload (Claims)
		‚óã Contains the actual data (user ID, email, roles, expiry time, etc.).
		‚óã Example:


{
  "userId": "123",
  "email": "ujjawal@example.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": 1692790400
}

	3. Signature
		‚óã A cryptographic hash made from Header + Payload + Secret key.
		‚óã Purpose: To make sure nobody changes the token data.


‚úÖ So in short:
	‚Ä¢ Header = Info about the token (meta data).
	‚Ä¢ Payload = Your actual info (claims).
	‚Ä¢ Signature = Proof that it‚Äôs valid and untampered.

1. What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?
	‚Ä¢ JWT is just a string (a token) that is used to prove your identity when you interact with a server.
	‚Ä¢ It is made of three parts:


Header.Payload.Signature
	1. Header ‚Üí info about token (like algorithm used)
	2. Payload ‚Üí your data (user id, email, roles, expiry time)
	3. Signature ‚Üí proves token is genuine (not tampered)
Example:


eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMjMiLCJlbWFpbCI6InVzZXJAZXhhbXBsZS5jb20ifQ
.sflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c

2. Why do we use JWT?
a) Stateless Authentication
	‚Ä¢ Traditional login: server keeps a session for each user ‚Üí takes memory.
	‚Ä¢ JWT: server doesn‚Äôt store anything. All info is inside the token.
b) Security
	‚Ä¢ The token has a signature, so no one can change it without the server knowing.
c) Easy to use across multiple servers
	‚Ä¢ Since server doesn‚Äôt store state, JWT works well in scalable apps (cloud, microservices).
d) Works well for APIs and mobile apps
	‚Ä¢ You can send the token with every request in Authorization: Bearer <token> header.

3. How it works (simple flow)
	1. User logs in with username/password.
	2. Server validates credentials ‚Üí creates JWT ‚Üí sends to user.
	3. User stores JWT (localStorage, cookie, etc.).
	4. User sends requests to server with JWT in Authorization header.
	5. Server verifies JWT ‚Üí if valid, allows access.
‚úÖ Analogy:
	‚Ä¢ Traditional session: like carrying a paper ID that the guard keeps in a register.
	‚Ä¢ JWT: like carrying a self-verifiable stamp on your hand. Guard doesn‚Äôt need to check any register ‚Äî the stamp itself proves your identity.

So basically, JWT is a secure, stateless way to prove who you are and manage access in web/mobile apps.

If you want, I can also draw a small diagram showing JWT login flow which makes it super easy to remember for interviews.

1. JWT is used in Authentication first ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢ Authentication = ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù (login)
	‚Ä¢ When a user logs in with username/password, the server verifies credentials.
	‚Ä¢ If correct, the server creates a JWT and sends it to the user.
	‚Ä¢ That JWT is proof of authentication.
So the first use of JWT is to prove identity.

2. JWT is also used in Authorization ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢ Authorization = ‚ÄúWhat can you do?‚Äù (permissions)
	‚Ä¢ The JWT contains user info and roles in its payload:


{
  "userId": "123",
  "role": "admin"
}
	‚Ä¢ Every time the user sends a request with JWT:
		‚óã Server reads the token
		‚óã Checks user role/permissions
		‚óã Decides if the user is allowed to access that resource
Example:
	‚Ä¢ JWT says role = "admin" ‚Üí can access /admin/dashboard
	‚Ä¢ JWT says role = "user" ‚Üí cannot access /admin/dashboard

‚úÖ In short:
Concept	JWT‚Äôs role
Authentication	Proves who the user is
Authorization	Determines what the user can do based on info inside the token

So JWT is used for both ‚Äî first to authenticate, then to authorize.

If you want, I can also draw a tiny diagram showing JWT in authentication vs authorization ‚Äî it‚Äôs very easy to remember for interviews.

Sure Ujjawal! Let‚Äôs go step by step for Authentication vs Authorization in a simple way, perfect for interviews.

1. Authentication Steps (‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù)
	1. User sends credentials
		‚óã User enters email/username + password on login page.
		‚óã React (frontend) sends this to backend API endpoint: /login.
	2. Server checks credentials
		‚óã Backend looks up the user in database.
		‚óã Compares password (after hashing).
	3. Server creates JWT
		‚óã If credentials are correct, server generates a JWT.
		‚óã JWT contains user info and expiry time.
	4. Server sends JWT to frontend
		‚óã Usually in response body or in HTTP-only cookie.
	5. Frontend stores JWT
		‚óã Can store in localStorage or cookies.
	6. User is now authenticated
		‚óã Every future request to protected routes must include JWT in Authorization header:
