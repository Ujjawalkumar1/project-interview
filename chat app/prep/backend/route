1. routes/ folder
	• In a Node.js/Express project, we organize API routes in a folder called routes/.
	• Routes are like addresses or paths on your server where clients (like your React app) can send requests.

2. userRoute.js
	• This file contains all the endpoints related to users.
	• Example endpoints:
		○ POST /signup → create a new user
		○ POST /login → login user
		○ GET /profile → get user info
It basically handles user authentication (who can log in or sign up).

3. messageRoute.js
	• This file contains all the endpoints related to messages.
	• Example endpoints:
		○ POST /message → send a message
		○ GET /messages → get messages for a user
It handles message sending and receiving.

4. "Maps HTTP methods to controller functions"
	• Each route defines what function should run when a client makes a request.
	• Example:


router.post("/login", loginUser); // POST request → run loginUser function
router.get("/messages", getMessages); // GET request → run getMessages function

	• HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE tell the server what action the client wants.
	• Controller functions are the functions that actually do the work (like check login, save a message, etc.).

✅ Simple analogy:
Concept	Analogy
routes/ folder	Map of all streets in a city
userRoute.js	Streets related to “users”
messageRoute.js	Streets related to “messages”
HTTP method + route	Street + traffic sign → decides where to go
Controller function	The person who actually does the job at that street

If you want, I can also draw a tiny diagram showing routes → HTTP method → controller function → response. It makes it super easy to visualize.
Do you want me to do that?
You said:
what is end point , route , route handeling etc for interview purpose 
ChatGPT said:
Alright Ujjawal, let’s break these clearly for interview purpose. I’ll explain in simple words and also give examples.

1. Endpoint
Meaning:
	• An endpoint is the specific URL on the server where a client (like your React app or Postman) can send a request.
	• It’s where the server listens and responds.
Example:
	• https://example.com/api/login → this is an endpoint for login.
	• https://example.com/api/messages → this is an endpoint for getting messages.
Interview way to say it:
	“An endpoint is a URL exposed by the backend where clients can send requests to access specific resources or perform actions.”

2. Route
Meaning:
	• A route is the path on the server that maps a request to a function.
	• Think of it as the server’s “address book” for handling requests.
Example in Express:


app.get("/messages", getMessages);
app.post("/login", loginUser);
	• /messages and /login are routes.
	• getMessages and loginUser are functions that run when route is hit.
Interview way to say it:
	“A route defines the URL path and HTTP method on the server and tells it which function to execute when that path is requested.”

3. Route Handling (Route Handler)
Meaning:
	• Route handling is the process of writing functions that respond to requests at a specific route.
	• The function that executes for a route is called a route handler.
Example:


// Route handling function
function loginUser(req, res) {
    const { email, password } = req.body;
    // logic to check user
    res.json({ message: "Logged in!" });
}
// Route mapping
app.post("/login", loginUser);
	• loginUser → route handler
	• /login → route
	• Client hitting /login → endpoint
Interview way to say it:
	“Route handling is the mechanism of defining functions that process requests to specific routes and send back responses.”

✅ Quick Summary Table for Interviews
Term	Meaning	Example
Endpoint	Full URL where the client sends requests	https://api.example.com/login
Route	Path on the server with HTTP method	/login (POST)
Route Handler	Function that runs when route is requested	loginUser(req, res)

If you want, I can also give a very short MERN stack example showing endpoint, route, and route handler in one diagram — perfect for interviews.
Do you want me to do that?
