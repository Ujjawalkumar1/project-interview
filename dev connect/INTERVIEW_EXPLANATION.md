## 🔧 **Backend Architecture Deep Dive (3-4 minutes)**

### **1. Server Setup (app.js)**
**"The backend is built with Express.js, which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Here's how I structured it:"**

```javascript
// Key Features:
- Express server with middleware setup
- CORS configuration for frontend communication
- Cookie parser for JWT token management
- Modular route structure
- MongoDB connection with error handling
```

**"I used middleware like CORS to allow secure communication between my React frontend and Node.js backend, and cookie-parser to handle JWT tokens securely."**

### **2. Database Design (MongoDB + Mongoose)**
**"I chose MongoDB as my database because it's perfect for social networking applications - it's flexible, scalable, and handles JSON-like data naturally."**

#### **User Model:**
```javascript
// Key Features:
- Comprehensive user profile (name, email, skills, about, photo)
- Password hashing with bcrypt for security
- JWT token generation methods
- Input validation and data sanitization
- Timestamps for user activity tracking
```

#### **Connection Request Model:**
```javascript
// Key Features:
- Tracks connection requests between users
- Status management (interested, ignored, accepted, rejected)
- Prevents self-requests with validation hooks
- Indexed queries for performance
```

### **3. API Design (RESTful Architecture)**
**"I designed RESTful APIs following industry best practices:"**

#### **Authentication Routes (/auth):**
- `POST /signup` - User registration with validation
- `POST /login` - Secure login with JWT tokens
- `POST /logout` - Secure logout by clearing cookies

#### **Profile Routes (/profile):**
- `GET /profile/view` - View user profile
- `PATCH /profile/edit` - Update profile with validation

#### **Connection Routes (/request):**
- `POST /request/send/:status/:userId` - Send connection requests
- `POST /request/review/:status/:requestId` - Accept/reject requests

#### **User Discovery Routes (/user):**
- `GET /feed` - Discover new users with pagination
- `GET /user/connections` - View accepted connections
- `GET /user/requests/received` - View pending requests

### **4. Security Implementation**
**"Security was a top priority. I implemented multiple layers:"**

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt for password security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive data validation
- **CORS Protection**: Secure cross-origin requests
- **HTTP-only Cookies**: XSS protection for tokens

## ⚛️ **Frontend Architecture Deep Dive (3-4 minutes)**

### **1. React Application Structure**
**"The frontend is built with modern React 19, using functional components and hooks for a clean, maintainable codebase."**

#### **Component Architecture:**
```
App.jsx (Main Router)
├── Body.jsx (Layout Component)
├── Login.jsx (Authentication)
├── Profile.jsx (Profile Management)
├── Feed.jsx (User Discovery)
├── Connections.jsx (Connection Management)
├── Requests.jsx (Request Management)
└── UserCard.jsx (Reusable User Display)
```

### **2. State Management with Redux Toolkit**
**"I used Redux Toolkit for global state management, which provides a predictable state container for the entire application."**

#### **Store Structure:**
```javascript
const appStore = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    user: userReducer,        // User authentication & profile
    feed: feedReducer,        // User discovery feed
    connections: connectionReducer,  // User connections
    requests: requestReducer, // Connection requests
  },
});
```

#### **Slice Pattern:**
**"Each feature has its own slice with actions and reducers. For example, the user slice manages authentication state, while the feed slice handles user discovery data."**

### **3. Modern Development Tools**
**"I used Vite as my build tool, which provides lightning-fast development and build times. For styling, I chose Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for rapid UI development."**

#### **Key Benefits:**
- **Vite**: Hot module replacement, fast builds
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **DaisyUI**: Pre-built components for rapid development
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication

### **4. Routing with React Router**
**"I implemented client-side routing using React Router DOM, which provides a seamless single-page application experience."**

```javascript
// Route Structure:
/           → Feed (User Discovery)
/login      → Authentication
/profile    → Profile Management
/connections → Connection List
/requests   → Request Management
```

## 🔄 **Data Flow & User Experience (2-3 minutes)**

### **1. User Registration Flow**
```
1. User fills signup form → Frontend validation
2. POST request to /signup → Backend validation
3. Password hashing → User creation in MongoDB
4. JWT token generation → Set in HTTP-only cookie
5. Redirect to feed → User can start discovering
```

### **2. User Discovery Flow**
```
1. User visits feed → Redux checks for existing data
2. API call to /feed → Backend queries MongoDB
3. Pagination & filtering → Exclude existing connections
4. Return user cards → Display in React components
5. User interactions → Send connection requests
```

### **3. Connection Management Flow**
```
1. User sends request → POST to /request/send
2. Backend validation → Check for duplicates
3. Save to database → Update connection status
4. Real-time updates → Redux state management
5. UI updates → Show connection status
```
